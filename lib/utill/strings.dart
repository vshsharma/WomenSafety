  <b>How to improve my picture evidence</b><br>
  Here are some tips for providing better picture evidence:
  <body>
  <li>  Allow Sisterhood to track your location and geotag your pictures. This allows the police to see where the picture was taken, which strengthens your case.</li>
  <li>  If you feel comfortable, ask a family member or friend you trust to take a picture of you and your injuries as well as a selfie of both of you. That way your family member or friend can corroborate your story and be your witness.</li>
  <li>  Take pictures of yourself and your injuries in your home or places you are known to frequently visit. That way the police can connect your injuries with known objects in your house. For instance, in front of your couch, in the kitchen where you can see the dining table/chairs in the background etc. The picture below shows an example: </li>
  <li>  Take multiple pictures over time. Injuries change over time, so make sure that you take pictures that reflect these changes. For instance, a bruise usually starts off being red. After 1-2 days the bruise will appear blue, purple or even black. After 5-10 days, your bruise turns yellow or green and after 10-14 days your bruise will likely have a yellowish brown or light brown color. Take pictures of these changes and use the “edit function” in the “View History” page to upload additional pictures.</li>

  <b>I have abruptly left my home but want to get my things from our apartment</b><br>
    If you had to urgently leave your home or if your abuser abruptly left and you 
    would like to receive or remove property, such as personal belongings, clothes, 
    electronics, furniture etc. you can apply for “Handräckning” via Kronofogden. You can read more about it here  
    Please note that handräckning has some consequences, for example if the defendant 
    objects to handräckningen, you can request Kronofodgen to hand over the case to a judge 
    who will make the decision. In certain special events, Kronofodgen will make the decision.
    When a decision is reached for both normal and special cases, Kronofogden will contact both 
    parties to see how the situation can be resolved in the most appropriate way. If it is not 
    possible to solve on a voluntary basis, Kronofogden can go into a home with a locksmith to get things out. 
  
  <br><br>
  <b>My partner has forced me to take on debt.</b> <br>
  If your partner has forced you (through threats or otherwise) to take on a debt, 
  you have to report it to the police as soon as possible. For these cases time is of the essence. 
  If you are getting collection letters from Kronofodgen, respond with an objection and explain 
  the circumstances. In some cases, Kronofodgen will invalidate the debt. Read more about it 
  <a href='https://kronofogden.se/forebygg-ekonomiska-problem/stod-i-arbetet/vald-i-nara-relation'>here</a>  
  
  <br><br>
  <b>I want to apply for sole custody of our child/children</b> <br>
  If you and your partner cannot come to an agreement you can file a lawsuit with 
  claims about how you want the court to decide on custody, housing and contact. 
  The court will then request an investigation from the Family Court. As part of the 
  investigation, conversations are held with both parents and the child / children if 
  it is appropriate with regard to the child's age and maturity. The family court 
  then gives a proposal for a decision regarding custody, housing, and contact that 
  should be in line with the child's best interests. This investigation, together with 
  the evidence presented and the conversations held in court, is the basis for the court's judgment.
  
  <br><br>
  <b>I don’t want to leave my partner, is there any support for those who abuse? </b> <br>
  Yes, there are organizations that support men who abuse. For instance, 
  <a href='https://www.manscentrum.se/'> Manscentrum </a> offers counseling, which can 
  help clarify, process and find solutions to men’s emotional and practical problems. 
  If your partner has been convicted for domestic abuse, then the Swedish Prison and Probation 
  Service offer treatment programs that are reviewed and quality assured.
