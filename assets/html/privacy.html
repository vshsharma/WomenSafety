<h3>How do we collect your data?</h3>
 
You provide Sisterhood with the data we collect when you:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle"> 
	<li>Download and create an account with Sisterhood.</li>
	<li> Voluntarily create content using our “new journal entry” feature.</li>
    <li>Provide feedback on our website and app.</li>
	<li>Use of view our website via your browser’s cookies.</li>
	<li>Engage with the app’s features. </li>
	<li>Upload images, videos, documents and sound files.</li>
 </ul>
 
<h3>How will we use your data?</h3>
 
We use the data you provide us with in the following ways: 
<ul style="list-style-type:circle"> 
	<li>Store evidence so you can, once you are ready, report the crimes you are experiencing. </li>
	<li>To keep a log of your activities in our products, which can later be used for evidence.</li> 
	<li>Enable you to keep a record of the crimes you are experiencing with an accurate timeline. For example, we collect timestamps of when you add a new journal entry or make edits to strengthen your evidence. </li>
	<li>Improve our product. By understanding how you interact with our products we can improve our features within the app and on our website. </li>
	<li>If you allow us to use your information when creating content, we have the ability to reduce defamation by using your location to link the experiences you provide to us. Tracking your location also strengthens your case as the police needs to ensure that you are who you say you are, and that there is a clear connection between the information you provide, such as text, videos, images, sound files and documents, and places that you frequently visit (your home, friends and family’s home, place of work, or areas surrounding your home). </li>
	<li>Sisterhood does not sell your information for ad purposes or partner with for profit companies to sell services, but we do sell and use your information for research purposes in order to better improve policies and legislation surrounding domestic abuse. By anonymizing your data, we can provide governments, municipalities, social services, police, and women’s shelters (among others) with better and more accurate statistics about domestic abuse. For example, Sisterhood can regionally provide municipalities with what type of abuse is most prevalent by using the information from our users in their area. </li>
	<li>To promote safety and security. We use your information to verify accounts and activity to prevent spam and harmful conduct. For example, we use the information you provide to investigate abuse in our app and violations of our terms and conditions. </li>
	<li>Research and innovate for the public good. Sisterhood’s goal is to empower domestically abused women and give them a voice in court by improving evidence. At our core, we conduct and support research to combat domestic violence and improve gender equality. For example, we analyze the information our users collectively provide to uncover patterns in domestic abuse and inform governments and legislators of the need for improved policies, funding, and overall resource allocation. </li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3>How will we store your data?</h3>
 
Our company securely stores your data using Google Cloud storage solutions and Firebase. Google Cloud's infrastructure has built-in protections to ensure that your information, identity, apps,          and devices are protected. Additionally, Google Cloud encrypts the data in transit between their facilities, which ensures that it can only be accessed by authorized roles. 
<br>
 <br>
Since the data Sisterhood is collecting serves to improve and strengthen evidence, the data will be stored for the duration of the prescription period, which varies depending on the crime. Thus, personal data is retained for as long as it is needed for the purposes of collecting evidence and building a criminal case.<br>
Based on the prescription period from 35 kap. 1 § Brottsbalken (BrB) the data will be stored as follows: 
<ul style="list-style-type:circle"> 
	<li>For murder where the maximum sentence is life in prison, the data will be stored for 25 years</li>
	<li>For violent abuse where the maximum sentence is over 8 years, the data will be stored for 15 years</li>
	<li>For violent abuse where the maximum sentence is 6 years, the data will be stored for 10 years</li>
	<li>For abuse where the maximum sentence is 2 years, the data will be stored for 5 years</li>
	<li>For abuse where the maximum sentence is 1 year, the data will be stored for 2 years.  </li>
</ul>
